# Flask Chatbot Project

This is a basic Python Flask backend for a chatbot. It includes:
- A main Flask app
- An endpoint for receiving chat messages
- A simple rule-based response function
- CORS support for frontend integration

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install flask flask-cors`
2. Run the app: `python app.py`

## Next Steps
- Connect a frontend (HTML/JS) to the `/chat` endpoint
- Expand chatbot logic or integrate with an AI API
